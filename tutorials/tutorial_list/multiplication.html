            Basic Multiplication Tutorial
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Basic Multiplication Tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll cover the fundamentals of
            multiplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiplication is the process of repeated addition. It's a way of adding the same number together multiple
            times.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Multiplying Positive Numbers
        </h1>
        <p>
            To multiply positive numbers, simply add the number to itself the specified number of times. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    2 x 3 = 6
    4 x 5 = 20
    7 x 8 = 56
    10 x 2 = 20
        </code></pre>
        <h1>
            Multiplying Negative Numbers
        </h1>
        <p>
            Multiplying negative numbers can result in a positive or negative product depending on the number of
            negative factors.
        </p>
        <li>
            Positive Multiplied by Positive is equal to Positive
        </li>
        <li>
            Negative Multiplied by Negative is equal to Positive
        </li>
        <li>
            Positive Multiplied by Negative is equal to Negative, And vice versa
        </li>
        <p>
            For Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    -2 x 3 = -6
    4 x -5 = -20
    -7 x -8 = 56
    -10 x -2 = 20
        </code></pre>

            How To Memorize Multiplication Table?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You Have 2 Options
        </p>
        <li>
            Either Memorize all of them
        </li>
        <li>
            Memorize or Familiarize them excluding tedious repeated pattern
        </li>

        <p>
            But we're gonna do the "Familiarize them excluding tedious repeated pattern"
            since it excludes the repeated pattern from multiplication of 6 to 9 with a 
            habit of switching their position
        </p>


        <h3>
            Multiplication of 1 and 2
        </h3>
        <p>
            you already know them pretty much especially you probably acquired it from addition for example:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
1 x 1 = 1  (1 repeat it 1 time and add up those is 1)
2 x 7 = 14 (2 repeat it 7 times and add up those is 14)
           (Or you can switch their position as 7 x 2 for simplifying this)
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multiplication of 5 and 10
        </h3>

        <p>
            One of the easiest multplication are 5 and 10 since for multiplication of 5 you definitely just need to familiarize them by 5 especially Multiplication by 10 since you just need to add 0 at the end for example
        </p>

        <pre><code>
5 x 3 = 15 "5 + 5 + 5 = 15"
5 x 5 = 25 "10 + 10 + 5 = 25" (what i did was merge the 'two 5' as 10 in order to visualize it) 

2 x 10 = 20 "2, 0"
110 x 10 = 1100 "110,0"
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multplication of 3 and 4
        </h3>
        <p>
            Definitely, Familiarize / Memorize them, Since Some of the numbers especially 6,7,8,9 are mention on multplication of 6 to 9, don't worry you would memorize them in no time XD
        </p>

        
        <pre><code>
// familiarize/memorize

3 x 1 = 3  (optional)
3 x 2 = 6  (optional)
3 x 3 = 9  (optional)
3 x 4 = 12 (optional)
3 x 5 = 15 (optional)
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30 (optional)

4 x 1 = 4   (optional)
4 x 2 = 8   (optional)
4 x 3 = 12  (optional)
4 x 4 = 16  (optional)
4 x 5 = 20  (optional)
4 x 6 = 24
4 x 7 = 28
4 x 8 = 32
4 x 9 = 36  
4 x 10 = 40 (optional)


        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multplication of Perfect Square
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is Essential Since this will make you easier in recognizing square roots. And once you memorize these, Multplication of 6 to 9 are easy peasy for you, and you definitely know these in no time. just memorize it in your convenient time
        </p>

        <pre><code>
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 6 = 36
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 8 = 64
9 x 9 = 81
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multplication of 6 to 9
        </h3>
        <p>
            You only need to memorize six of these and you're good to go since half of those are the repeated pattern throughout every multiplication of 1 to 9, you only need to switch their position in order to get a better view of your multiplication.
        </p>

        
        <pre><code>
6 x 7 = 42
6 x 8 = 48
6 x 9 = 54
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
8 x 9 = 72
        </code></pre>
