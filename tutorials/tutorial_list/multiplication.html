            Basic Multiplication Tutorial
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Basic Multiplication Tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll cover the fundamentals of
            multiplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiplication is the process of repeated addition. It's a way of adding the same number together multiple
            times.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Multiplying Positive Numbers
        </h1>
        <p>
            To multiply positive numbers, simply add the number to itself the specified number of times. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    0 x 2 = <blue>0</blue> <red>or</red> 0 + 0 = <blue>0</blue>
    2 x 3 = <blue>6</blue> <red>or</red> 2 + 2 + 2 = <blue>6</blue> 
    4 x 5 = <blue>20</blue> <red>or</red> 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = <blue>20</blue>
    7 x 8 = <blue>56</blue> <red>or</red> 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = <blue>56</blue>
    2 x 10 = <blue>20</blue> <red>or</red> 10 + 10 = <blue>20</blue>
        </code></pre>
        <h1>
            Multiplying Negative Numbers
        </h1>
        <p>
            Multiplying negative numbers can result in a positive or negative product depending on the number of
            negative factors.
        </p>
        <li>
            Positive Multiplied by Positive is equal to Positive
        </li>
        <li>
            Negative Multiplied by Negative is equal to Positive
        </li>
        <li>
            Positive Multiplied by Negative is equal to Negative, And vice versa
        </li>
        <p>
            For Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    -2 x 3 = <blue>-6</blue>
    4 x -5 = <blue>-20</blue>
    -7 x -8 = <blue>56</blue>
    -10 x -2 = <blue>20</blue>
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Why Negative(-) to Negative(-) Results to Positive Numbers?
        </p>
        <p>
            here's the scenario:
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets say a <red>Positive Force (3)</red> Is Positive, Then we applied a <red>Positive Force (2)</red> on progress Bar, it results A <blue>Positive Results (6)</blue>
        </p>
        <p>
            What About for Negative To Positive?, Lets say a <red>Positive Force (3)</red> Was Applied With <red>Opposite Force (-1)</red> The Results Would Be <blue>Reverse (-3)</blue>
        </p>
        <p>
            What About if Both Are <red>Opposite Forces?</red>, Then if <red>Opposite Force (-9)</red> Meets <red>Opposite Force (-9)</red> then the results will be <blue>Positive Force (81)</blue> 
        </p>

        <p>
            You Have 3 Options
        </p>
        <li>
            Either Memorize all of them
        </li>
        <li>
            Memorize or Familiarize them excluding tedious repeated pattern
        </li>

        <p>
            But we're gonna do the <blue>
                "Familiarize them excluding tedious repeated pattern"
            </blue>
            since it excludes the repeated pattern from multiplication of 6 to 9 with a 
            habit of switching their position
        </p>


        <h3>
            Multiplication of 1 and 2
        </h3>
        <p>
            you already know them pretty much especially you probably acquired it from addition for example:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
1 x 1 = <blue>1</blue>  (1 repeat it 1 time and add up those is 1)
2 x 7 = <blue>14</blue> (2 repeat it 7 times and add up those is 14)
           (Or you can switch their position as 7 x 2 for simplifying this)
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multiplication of 5 and 10
        </h3>

        <p>
            One of the easiest multplication are 5 and 10 since for multiplication of 5 you definitely just need to familiarize them by 5 especially Multiplication by 10 since you just need to add 0 at the end <red>or</red> if there's a decimal point, you need move the decimal on right side for example
        </p>

        <pre><code>
5 x 3 = <blue>15</blue> "5 + 5 + 5 = <blue>15</blue>"
5 x 5 = <blue>25</blue> "10 + 10 + 5 = <blue>25</blue>" (what i did was merge the 'two 5' as 10 in order to visualize it) 

2 x 10 = <blue>20</blue> "2, 0"
110 x 10 = <blue>1100</blue> "110,0"

2.55 x 10 = <blue>25.5</blue>
0.75 x 10 = <blue>7.5</blue>
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multplication of 3 and 4
        </h3>
        <p>
            Definitely, Familiarize / Memorize them, Since Some of the numbers especially 6,7,8,9 are mention on multplication of 6 to 9, don't worry you would memorize them in no time XD
        </p>

        
        <pre><code>
// familiarize/Memorize

3 x 1 = <blue>3</blue>  (optional)
3 x 2 = <blue>6</blue>  (optional)
3 x 3 = <blue>9</blue>  (optional)
3 x 4 = <blue>12</blue> (optional)
3 x 5 = <blue>15</blue> (optional)
3 x 6 = <blue>18</blue>
3 x 7 = <blue>21</blue>
3 x 8 = <blue>24</blue>
3 x 9 = <blue>27</blue>
3 x 10 = <blue>30</blue> (optional)

4 x 1 = <blue>4</blue>   (optional)
4 x 2 = <blue>8</blue>  (optional)
4 x 3 = <blue>12</blue>  (optional)
4 x 4 = <blue>16</blue>  (optional)
4 x 5 = <blue>20</blue>  (optional)
4 x 6 = <blue>24</blue>
4 x 7 = <blue>28</blue>
4 x 8 = <blue>32</blue>
4 x 9 = <blue>36</blue>  
4 x 10 = <blue>40</blue> (optional)

        <h3>
            Multplication of Perfect Square
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is Essential Since this will make you easier in recognizing square roots. And once you memorize these, Multplication of 6 to 9 are easy peasy for you, and you definitely know these in no time. just memorize it in your convenient time
        </p>

        <pre><code>
1 x 1 = <blue>1 </blue> 
2 x 2 = <blue>4</blue>
3 x 3 = <blue>9</blue>
4 x 4 = <blue>16</blue>
5 x 5 = <blue>25</blue>
6 x 6 = <blue>36</blue>
7 x 7 = <blue>49</blue>
8 x 8 = <blue>64</blue>
9 x 9 = <blue>81</blue>
        </code></pre>

        <h3>
            Multplication of 6 to 9
        </h3>
        <p>
            You only need to memorize six of these and you're good to go since half of those are the repeated pattern throughout every multiplication of 1 to 9, you only need to switch their position in order to get a better view of your multiplication.
        </p>

        
        <pre><code>
6 x 7 = <blue>42</blue>
6 x 8 = <blue>48</blue>
6 x 9 = <blue>54</blue>
7 x 8 = <blue>56</blue>
7 x 9 = <blue>63</blue>
8 x 9 = <blue>72</blue>
        </code></pre>
